# Excel Data Cleaning Tool

## Description
This Python script is designed to process Excel files containing different word categories (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.) by removing spaces from all entries. The cleaned data is then exported to a CSV file for further use.

## Features
- Removes spaces from all text entries in the Excel file
- Processes multiple word categories:
  - Nouns
  - Adjectives
  - Verbs
  - Adverbs
  - Prepositions
  - Miscellaneous words
- Exports cleaned data to CSV format

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - openpyxl (required by pandas for Excel file processing)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the script
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

## Input File Format
The script expects an Excel file named `phrases.xlsx` with the following columns:
- noun
- adjectives
- verbs
- adverbs
- prepositions
- miscellaneous

## Usage
1. Place your Excel file (`phrases.xlsx`) in the same directory as the script
2. Run the script:
```bash
python excel_cleaning.py
```
3. The script will generate a new file named `cleaned_phrases.csv` containing the cleaned data

## Output
The script generates a CSV file (`cleaned_phrases.csv`) with the following:
- All spaces removed from text entries
- Original column structure maintained
- No index column in the output file

## Error Handling
- Ensure your Excel file contains all the required columns
- Make sure the Excel file is not open in another program while running the script
- Verify that you have write permissions in the directory
